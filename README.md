### Subject

This graduation thesis was completed with a lot of reasearch, development and effort. The goal was detection of lung diseases with both machine and deep learning models. For deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks were used to achieve the desired classficiation job. 

### Dataset

The dataset that was used is COVID-19 Radiography Database is provided in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database/code
The distribution of the dataset was shown in the following graph.

There were four approaches to classify mammographic images. Each one is performed by using the most appropriate algorithms and implementation configurations. Necessary research and fine-tuning operations were done properly to enhance the system's performance. The four approaches were listed below in a figure.

### Conclusion

In this research and implementation project, it was aimed to work on a medical image dataset with traditional image processing techniques and deep learning method. After reading all the images, a crucial step preprocessing was done to have a proper shape of the data to process. Then, by extracting features of the images with different methods, it was desired to have a great representation of the images in machine side. In order to achieve the goal, the study was splitted into four main parts. In each one, the relevant operations are completed with research of efficient ways of implementation. Also, additional studies such as machine learning performance enhancement with grid search, fine tuning, visualization and analysis of dataset were carried on to be able to make the system work better. Comparison of methods has got significance in computer science projects and in this study, all the methods were compared with each other, and they were being improved with different approaches.
